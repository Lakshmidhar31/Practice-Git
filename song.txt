I found a Love, for me
Darling just dive right in
Follow my lead
I found a girl, beautiful and sweet

Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time

Darling just hold my hand
Be my girl and i'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
